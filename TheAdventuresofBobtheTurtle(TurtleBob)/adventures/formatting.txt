The first line is the title of the page, which will appear centered on the second line of the screen
The second line is the body text of the page
The remaining lines are the choices in the format:
	filenameoftheadventurethatthattoptionleadsto:Text of the choice

So, a file consisting of:

<BEGIN FILE, THIS LINE WOULD NOT ACTUALLY BE IN THE FILE>
The Mines of Moria
You have entered the Mines of Moria and there are two doors.\nWhich do you take?
dragonslair:The one to the left
crypts:The one to the right
<END FILE, NOT ACTUALLY THERE, LIKE BEFORE>

Might render like:

===============================
      The Mines of Moria

You have entered the Mines of
Moria and there are two doors.
Which do you take?

1. The one to the right

2. The one to the left


Keep in mind that the choices are randomized from how they're written in the file, thataway there's no bias. Yay statistics!(?)
